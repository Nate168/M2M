    <tr><td>1<span class=TR4">DEFINITIONS:</span>All capitalized terms not expressly defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the applicable Master Agreement.<br /><br />
      2<span class=TR4">AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE:</span>Client agrees to purchase from CallPass, subject to the terms set forth herein, and CallPass agrees to sell to Client, the Offerings identified on an applicable Agreement, or otherwise ordered by Client, to be used by Client in accordance with this Agreement.  Where the Offering is identified as a “License,” such Offering is licensed to Client, and not sold.  License terms are set forth in the applicable Item Terms or, where applicable, Website Terms. Certain Offerings that are not identified as a “License” may include embedded software or other intellectual property within the product being purchased.  Such embedded intellectual property, if any, is licensed, and not sold, to Client.  Terms and conditions of licenses for embedded intellectual property, if any, are set forth on the applicable Item Terms or on the CallPass website.  Except as is expressly set forth in this Agreement, CallPass expressly reserves any and all rights in and to those Offerings and embedded software or other intellectual property that are licensed.<br /><br />
      3<span class=TR4">DEFAULT:</span>The parties shall be in default under this Agreement if they fail to perform any of their obligations, make any false or misleading representations, violate state or federal laws pertaining to the Offerings or become delinquent in payment.  In the event either party shall be in default, this Agreement may be terminated at the option of the non-defaulting party, with said termination effective as of the date of the earliest event constituting default upon written notice from the non-defaulting party to the defaulting party.  Termination of this Agreement shall immediately terminate any and all licenses granted by CallPass in connection with this Agreement.  The defaulting party agrees to reimburse the non-defaulting party upon demand, for all costs, expenses and attorney’s fees incurred by the non-defaulting party under the terms of this Agreement. <br /><br />
      4<span class=TR4">NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP:</span>Client and CallPass, as independent parties, expressly agree that this Agreement in no way creates a joint venture, partnership, financing agreement or any other relationship, whether formal or informal, between Client and CallPass or Client and CallPass's service providers, suppliers or licensors.<br /><br />
      5<span class=TR4">LIMITATIONS:</span>Under no circumstances will CallPass and/or its suppliers, licensors, affiliates or any of its or their directors, officers, employees, agents or subcontractors be liable under any theory of tort, contract, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for lost profits, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, each of which is hereby excluded by agreement of the parties regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable or whether CallPass or any employee, officer or entity has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply in such jurisdictions.  It is the intention of the parties, however, that the above limitations shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.<br /><br />
      <span  class="BOLD">NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL CALLPASS’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY, INCLUDING FOR CLAIMS, EXPENSES, DAMAGES OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).</span><br /><br />
      <span  class="BOLD">CLIENT BEARS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE USE OF THE OFFERINGS PURCHASED OR LICENSED HEREUNDER CONFORM TO APPLICABLE, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. CALLPASS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION WHATSOEVER OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CLIENT’S APPLICATION OR USE OF ANY OFFERING.</span><br /><br />
      <span  class="BOLD">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE APPLICABLE ITEM TERMS, ALL OFFERINGS ARE PROVIDED AS-IS, AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CALLPASS HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES.

      <span  class="BOLD">THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT CALLPASS PRICING IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE ALLOCATION OF RISK RESULTING FROM THESE LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES AND ACTIONS, AND THE DISCLAIMERS THROUGHOUT THIS AGREEMENT,  AND THAT THEY ARE MATERIAL TERMS WITHOUT WHICH CALLPASS WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. </span><br /><br />

      12<span  class="TR4">FORCE MAJEURE:</span>With the exception of payment obligations, neither party to this Agreement will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, acts of government, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, embargoes, fires, natural disasters, accidents, riots, sabotage, strikes, labor disputes or labor shortages, shortages of materials or supplies, failures of transportation, communication or digital transmissions, internet failures or delays and third party mechanical or other equipment breakdowns.

CallPass will, at its sole option and expense, repair, modify, or replace (with a same or substantially similar product, as determined by CallPass) any Device, part or component which does not conform with this warranty, and will do so without additional charge when Device is returned to CallPass. All replaced Devices and parts become property of CallPass. Repairs may be made with new or used components, provided that used components shall meet CallPass’s applicable standards. This limited warranty does not include repair to damage, which, in the sole judgment of CallPass, resulted from accident, misuse, abuse or non-CallPass modification to the Device. Return of the repaired Device does not include insurance, postage, shipping, handling, or applicable customs and duties, all of which shall be the sole responsibility of Client.  This warranty is not transferable.  CallPass’s liability, and your exclusive remedy for breach of warranty, is limited to repair or replacement as provided above.  This express warranty is contingent upon the proper use of the Device in accordance with all specifications and instructions of CallPass. The warranty does not apply to Devices which have been tampered with or altered mechanically or electronically in any way (including without limitation re-crystallization), or (i) defect, damage or failure resulting from  disasters, natural causes, accidents, act of God, abuse or misuse; (ii) defect, damage or failure resulting from power surges or other defect of electrical power or external circuitry, (iii) defect, damage or failure resulting from water, fire, or chemical damage; (iv) Devices whose casings, warranty/quality stickers, product serial number stickers, have been removed, written on, defaced, altered, or rendered illegible; (v) use or operation outside of the usage parameters set forth in CallPass's specifications, or (v) anyone other than CallPass or its authorized representative modifying, repairing or servicing the Device.  You must contact CallPass for an return merchandise authorization  (RMA) number prior to returning any Device to CallPass for warranty service.  Any Device received without an RMA number may be returned to the sender by CallPass without  repairs.<br /><br />

      9<span  class="TR4">INSTALLATION:</span>All Devices must be installed according to CallPass’s specifications and any provided instructions.  Unauthorized or improper installation voids CallPass’s limited warranty and results in the immediate termination of any license for any embedded software or other intellectual property.

      10<span  class="TR4">PAYMENT:</span>Except as otherwise agreed between CallPass and Client in a properly signed writing, Devices must be paid for before they are shipped.  To the extent Client receives Devices prior to executing or otherwise acknowledging its acceptance of this Agreement, Client’s use of any one of the Devices (or any Services relating to such Devices) shall represent Client’s acceptance of the Agreement.  In the event Client does not accept the Agreement, Devices may be returned to CallPass for a refund by calling CallPass and receiving a return merchandise authorization (RMA) and following CallPass’s standard return procedures.  <br /><br />
      Airtime charges for Services are billed in advance, at the beginning of each period, based on the Client’s service plan.  Service plans may be updated from time to time by CallPass or its suppliers and the terms and conditions in effect as of activation of a Device or at the time of renewal shall apply.
